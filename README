Pupil
=====

1. Connect the hardware.

2. Run Pupil Capture:

	In a new terminal:
	$ sudo ./run-pupil.sh

	We are then inside the Docker container. Launch the application:
	# python3 pupil_src/capture/main.py

	Pupil documentation:
	https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/wiki

3. Run cosy-pupil-server:

	In a new terminal:
	$ sudo ./run-cosy-pupil-server.sh

	Inside the container:
	# ./external-recorder

4. Do the calibration with Pupil Capture.

5. Run the experiment from Matlab (it's the client side).

6. Close the programs properly:

	- Close the main window of Pupil Capture (the one with the world camera).
	- Exit the Pupil container with Ctrl+D or the "exit" command.
	- Kill cosy-pupil-server with Ctrl+C.
	- Exit the cosy-pupil-server container with Ctrl+D or the "exit" command.

	You must exit the containers properly, not closing the terminal
	directly, because otherwise the container still runs in the background
	and might screw up your next experiment.

	To kill all containers, you can execute:
	$ sudo docker stop $(sudo docker ps -a -q)
	$ sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -a -q)
