Pupil
=====

1. Connect the hardware.

2. Ensure that no other Docker containers run:

	In a new terminal:
	$ ./kill-all-containers.sh

	If a container from a previous experiment is not properly closed, it
	can still run in the background and can screw up your new experiment.

3. Run Pupil Capture:

	In a new terminal:
	$ ./run-pupil.sh

	We are then inside the Docker container. Launch the application:
	# python3 pupil_src/capture/main.py

	Pupil documentation:
	https://docs.pupil-labs.com/

4. Run cosy-pupil-server:

	In a new terminal:
	$ ./run-cosy-pupil-server.sh

	Inside the container:
	# ./external-recorder

5. Do the calibration with Pupil Capture.

6. Run the experiment from Matlab (it's the client side).

7. Close the programs:

	- Close the main window of Pupil Capture (the one with the world camera).
	- Exit the Pupil container with Ctrl+D or the "exit" command.
	- Kill cosy-pupil-server with Ctrl+C.
	- Exit the cosy-pupil-server container with Ctrl+D or the "exit" command.

	If the containers are not properly closed (if you close the terminal
	window directly), the containers still run in the background, but they
	would anyway be cleaned up with the kill-all-containers.sh script.
