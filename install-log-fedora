Pupil install on Fedora 25
==========================

Install Fedora 25 spin Xfce. Xfce is a more stable desktop than gnome-shell.

The first Pupil installation was on CentOS, because CentOS is supported during
10 years while Fedora is supported during only ~13 months. But a more recent
graphics stack was needed to run the latest version of Pupil Capture. Maybe
when CentOS 7.4 will be released it'll be possible to come back on CentOS.
Anyway the computer is normally not connected on the network, it is connected
only for doing the installation or doing updates, and a Linux system is anyway
quite secure even if it is not up-to-date. Fedora has been chosen to stay in
the same family of Linux distros (Red Hat family).
