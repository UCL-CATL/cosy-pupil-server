Troubleshooting
===============

Some encountered problems, with solutions.

Cannot bind ZeroMQ socket
-------------------------

Maybe another Docker container was not terminated correctly and is a "zombie"
process. When gnome-terminal is closed while the container is still running,
the container is not removed, which can block the access to the TCP port.

To see all Docker containers:
$ sudo docker ps -a

To remove all Docker containers at once:
$ sudo docker stop $(sudo docker ps -a -q)
$ sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -a -q)
